# AI Protector — Roadmap

> MVP is complete (Phases 1–5 + 7). The **immediate next milestone is Agents v1** —
> turning agent security from a demo into a product pillar.
> Features below are grouped into phases, roughly ordered by priority and dependency.

---

## Phase 0: Agents v1 🔜 (in progress — primary focus)

> **Full spec:** [`agents-v1.spec.md`](agents-v1.spec.md)
> **Implementation guides:** [`agents-implementation/`](agents-implementation/README.md)

New product pillar: **Agents** — register any agent (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, raw Python),
map its tools and roles, generate guardrail configs, validate with attack tests, deploy safely.

| # | Requirement | Status |
|---|------------|--------|
| 1 | Agent registration (profile, risk level, recommended preset) | Not started |
| 2 | Tools + roles CRUD (RBAC, default-deny, confirmation, publish config) | Reference code exists (YAML), no API/UI |
| 3 | Generated config (`rbac.yaml`, limits, policy pack) | Not started |
| 4 | Integration kit (pre/post gate, snippets, tests — 7 files) | Reference code exists, no generator |
| 5 | Attack validation runner | Gate logic works, no automated runner |
| 6 | Observe / Warn / Enforce rollout modes | Not started (v1.1) |
| 7 | Traces with decision + reason | Working (needs per-agent filtering + DB persistence) |

**Implementation order:** Agent CRUD → Tools/Roles → Config generation → Integration kit → Validation → Rollout modes → Traces

**Release gate tiers:** Reqs 1–5 + 7 = core release gate (must ship). Req 6 (rollout modes) = v1.1 (ship right after). See [agents-v1.spec.md — Release gate tiers](agents-v1.spec.md) for details.

**Key risk:** Integration kit is the core product — must generate real, working files, not just previews.

**What already exists:**
- Agent Demo app with full LangGraph graph (11 nodes), RBAC, pre/post-tool gates, argument validation, budgets
- Scan + LLM call architecture (Step 1: scan-only via proxy `/v1/scan`, Step 2: full context to LLM provider)
- 421 agent-demo tests passing
- 8 detailed implementation guides in `docs/agents-implementation/`
- Reference implementations for all security mechanisms in `apps/agent-demo/`

## Phase 1: Red Team Lab (after Agents v1)

The second pillar of AI Protector. Transforms the project from "just a firewall" into a full **offensive + defensive AI security platform**.

### 1.1. Red Team Attack Engine

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Attack Campaigns** | Named attack sessions with target policy, model, and goal |
| **garak SDK Integration** | Use garak (LLM vulnerability scanner) as the core attack library |
| **Attack Types** | Prompt injection (direct, indirect), jailbreak (DAN, AIM, role-play), PII extraction, system prompt leak, multi-turn escalation, hallucination probing |
| **LangGraph Attack Agent** | Agentic attacker: plans strategy → selects technique → executes → evaluates → adapts |
| **Campaign Dashboard** | Progress, success/fail matrix, technique effectiveness, timeline |

### 1.3. Attack Library

| Category | Techniques |
|----------|-----------|
| Prompt Injection | Direct instruction override, indirect (via context), delimiter confusion, encoding (base64, ROT13) |
| Jailbreak | DAN, AIM, role-play ("you are a hacker"), multi-persona, hypothetical framing |
| Data Extraction | System prompt leak attempts, PII fishing, canary token extraction, training data extraction |
| Multi-turn | Gradual trust building, context poisoning, history manipulation, topic drift escalation |
| Tool Abuse | Attempt to call restricted tools, parameter injection, tool chaining exploits |
| Encoding | Unicode homoglyphs, zero-width chars, markdown injection, HTML entities |

### 1.4. Key Deliverables

- [ ] Attack campaign CRUD (API + UI)
- [ ] garak integration (selected probes)
- [ ] LangGraph attack agent (basic strategy)
- [ ] Report generation (per-campaign results)
- [ ] Red Team dashboard in frontend
- [ ] Red vs Blue comparison view

---

## Phase 2: Advanced Blue Team (after Red Team Lab)

### 2.1. Adaptive Policies

- **Auto-escalation**: if block rate spikes, automatically tighten policy (balanced → strict)
- **Client reputation scores**: clients with history of blocked requests get higher scrutiny
- **Time-based policies**: stricter after hours, relaxed during business hours
- **Policy versioning**: full history, diff view, rollback

### 2.2. Advanced Agent Security

> **Note:** The foundation for agent management is being built in **Agents v1** (Phase 0). Items marked ✅ below are addressed there. This phase covers the advanced features that build on top of v1.

| Feature | Description | Agents v1? |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Multi-agent support** | Multiple agents with different configs behind one proxy | ✅ Agent registration + per-agent config |
| **Agent fingerprinting** | Identify which agent made each request (by client-id patterns) | ✅ agent_id on every request/trace |
| **Tool-call auditing** | Log every tool call with parameters, not just LLM calls | ✅ Full trace with tool calls + gate decisions |
| **Cross-agent correlation** | Detect coordinated attacks across multiple agents | Phase 2 — needs multi-agent data first |
| **Agent health scoring** | Dashboard panel showing per-agent risk profile over time | ✅ Partial — validation scorecard + trace stats |

### 2.3. Session/Memory Agent

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Session context tracking** | Track full conversation context across turns |
| **Memory poisoning detection** | Detect gradual injection via multi-turn conversations |
| **Context window management** | Smart truncation that preserves security-relevant history |
| **Session risk escalation** | Risk score increases as session shows suspicious patterns |
| **Automatic session termination** | Kill sessions that exceed risk thresholds |

### 2.4. NeMo Guardrails Deep Integration

- Colang 2.0 flows for complex dialog patterns
- Custom actions for domain-specific checks
- Programmable dialog rails (e.g., refuse to generate code if policy says so)
- Topic control (prevent off-topic conversations)

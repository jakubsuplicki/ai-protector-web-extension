# AI Protector — Agents v1 Specification

> **Scope:** Agents as a standalone product pillar — registration, protection, validation, rollout, observability
> **Prerequisite:** MVP (proxy firewall, playground, agent demo) — done
> **Minimum product truth:** "AI Protector helps you register an agent, define tool permissions, generate deterministic guardrails, validate them with attack tests, and roll them out with visibility."

---

## Product pillar: Agents

Agents is a **separate section** in AI Protector — not scattered across Policies, Demo, or Analytics.

Everything that answers "how do I secure this specific agent?" lives here.

### Sidebar layout (v1)

```
Dashboard
Playground
Compare
Policies             ← global policy library
Agents               ← NEW: onboarding + lifecycle
Traces               ← renamed from "Agent Traces"
Analytics
Settings
```

### Inside Agents

```
Agents List          ← entry point, all registered agents
New Agent Wizard     ← 7-step onboarding flow
Agent Detail         ← per-agent management
  Overview           ← profile, risk, active pack, incidents
  Tools & Access     ← tools table, roles, RBAC, confirmations, budgets
  Integration        ← generated config, code snippets, env vars, download
  Validation         ← attack packs, runs, scorecard
  Traces             ← blocked calls, redactions, confirmations, timings
  Rollout            ← observe / warn / enforce, envs, promotion
```

### What moves where

| Current location | New location | What changes |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Agent Demo (`/agent`) | Agents → Demo Agent | Becomes a reference/showcase agent, not the main entry point |
| Agent Traces (`/agent-traces`) | Agents → `{agent}` → Traces (and global Traces) | Per-agent traces inside agent detail, global view stays |
| Policies (`/policies`) | Policies (stays) | Global policy library; agent-specific binding happens in Agents |
| Security Rules (`/rules`) | Policies sub-section or stays | No change needed for v1 |

---

## The 7 v1 requirements

### Req 1: Agent registration

User must be able to say: what agent, has tools?, write actions?, touches PII?, risk level.

#### Current state

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Working code | **None** — no registration endpoint, no DB model |
| UI | **None** — no registration form |
| Reference | Agent demo has hardcoded `config.py` — not a registration flow |
| Documentation | `docs/agents-implementation/01-describe-agent.md` — full questionnaire spec |

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] **API:** `POST /agents` creates an agent profile
- [ ] **API:** `GET /agents` lists all registered agents
- [ ] **API:** `GET /agents/:id` returns agent detail
- [ ] **API:** `PATCH /agents/:id` updates agent profile
- [ ] **DB model:** `Agent` table — name, description, team, framework, has_tools, has_write_actions, touches_pii, risk_level (low/medium/high/critical), created_at, updated_at
- [ ] **Risk classification:** Auto-computed from capabilities (write + PII + public-facing → critical)
- [ ] **UI — Agents List:** Table with columns: name, team, environment, protection level, pack, last validation, rollout mode, status
- [ ] **UI — Register form:** Step 1 of wizard — name, description, framework, capabilities checkboxes, risk computed live
- [ ] **Test:** Create agent via API → appears in list → detail page accessible

---

### Req 2: Tools + roles registration

User must be able to: add tools, mark read/write/sensitive, assign roles, set default-deny, mark tools requiring confirmation.

#### Current state

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Working code | **Full** — `rbac_config.yaml`, `rbac/service.py`, `rbac/models.py`, `tools/registry.py` |
| Default-deny | **Working** — `check_permission()` returns DENY if `(role, tool)` not found |
| Confirmation flow | **Working** — `requires_confirmation` in RBAC config, pre-tool gate checks it |
| UI | **None** — no CRUD for tools or roles |
| Limitation | YAML-only, requires restart to change |

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] **API:** `POST /agents/:id/tools` registers a tool (name, description, category, sensitivity, requires_confirmation, arg_schema)
- [ ] **API:** `GET /agents/:id/tools` lists tools for an agent
- [ ] **API:** `POST /agents/:id/roles` creates a role with tool permissions
- [ ] **API:** `GET /agents/:id/roles` lists roles with permission matrix
- [ ] **DB model:** `AgentTool` table — agent_id, name, description, category (read/write/admin), sensitivity (low/medium/high/critical), requires_confirmation, arg_schema (JSON)
- [ ] **DB model:** `AgentRole` table — agent_id, name, inherits_from
- [ ] **DB model:** `RoleToolPermission` table — role_id, tool_id, scopes (JSON: [read, write]), sensitivity_override, requires_confirmation, conditions (JSON, nullable). Relational join table, not a flat JSON array — this needs to support scopes, confirmation, conditions, and per-role sensitivity overrides without schema migration later.
- [ ] **Default-deny:** If tool not in role's permission set → DENY (already works in code, must persist to DB)
- [ ] **UI — Tools & Access tab:** Tools table with inline edit, roles table, permission matrix grid (role × tool)
- [ ] **UI — Wizard step 2-3:** Tool registration form + role mapping
- [ ] **Publish config:** Explicit "Publish config" button in UI (or `POST /agents/:id/publish`) triggers runtime reload of RBAC + limits. No watch/poll magic — user controls when changes go live. This prevents accidental partial configs from being picked up mid-edit.
- [ ] **Test:** Register tool via API → assign to role → publish → check_permission returns ALLOW; unassigned → DENY

---

### Req 3: Generated RBAC + policy config

After configuration, user must get a real artifact: rbac.yaml, limits config, basic policy pack.

#### Current state

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| rbac.yaml | **Exists** — `rbac_config.yaml` in agent-demo, loaded at startup |
| Limits config | **Exists** — `limits/config.py` dataclass with per-role overrides |
| Policy packs | **Documented** — 5 packs in `04-policy-packs.md`, not as code templates |
| Generation | **None** — no auto-generation from agent profile |
| Policy CRUD | **Working** — proxy service has full policy API |

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] **Generation endpoint:** `POST /agents/:id/generate-config` → creates rbac.yaml + limits.yaml + policy pack based on agent profile + registered tools + roles
- [ ] **rbac.yaml output:** Valid YAML with roles, tool permissions, sensitivity, inheritance
- [ ] **limits.yaml output:** Valid YAML with per-role rate limits, token budgets, cost caps
- [ ] **Policy pack selection:** 5 pre-built packs (customer_support, internal_copilot, finance, hr, research) selectable in wizard
- [ ] **Policy pack = concrete template:** Each pack is a YAML file containing: (a) scanner toggles (pii_redaction, secrets_scanning, injection_detection — on/off), (b) threshold values (injection_score, risk_score, max_output_size), (c) limit defaults per role tier (rate, tokens, cost), (d) redaction mode (mask/replace/block), (e) confirmation rules (which sensitivity levels require it). Not just a name — a full config that produces deterministic runtime behavior.
- [ ] **Policy pack binding:** Selected pack is stored on agent record and loaded at runtime
- [ ] **Download:** User can download generated files as individual files or .zip
- [ ] **Copy-to-clipboard:** Each generated file has a copy button
- [ ] **UI — Wizard step 4:** Policy pack selector with comparison table
- [ ] **UI — Integration tab:** Shows generated configs with copy/download
- [ ] **Test:** Register agent with 3 tools + 2 roles → generate config → YAML is valid and contains all tools/roles → download works

> **Architectural principle — source of truth:** The database is the source of truth inside AI Protector. Generated files (rbac.yaml, limits.yaml, policy.yaml, .env.protector, etc.) are **deployment artifacts** derived from DB state — not the other way around. The UI edits the DB; the "Generate" / "Download" actions produce files from DB state. This prevents UI ↔ YAML ↔ runtime divergence.

---

### Req 4: Working integration kit

Generated code that user copies into their project. This is the most important v1 deliverable.

> **⚠️ HIGHEST RISK:** This is the heart of the product and the hardest part of v1. The integration kit generator is not a "medium task" — it IS the main product. Scope guard for v1: generate only (1) LangGraph wrapper, (2) raw Python wrapper, (3) proxy-only mode, (4) config download, (5) smoke tests. Do not attempt advanced templating, multi-framework magic, or perfect code generation. Ship working files, iterate later.
>
> **Template-based, not generated:** In v1, all generated code is **template-based with parameter substitution** (Jinja2 or string interpolation), not semantic code generation. The generator fills in agent name, tool list, role names, thresholds — it does NOT reason about framework structure or produce novel code. This prevents scope creep into "AI generates your integration" territory.

#### Current state

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Pre-tool gate | **Full** — `pre_tool_gate.py` (463 lines), 5 checks: RBAC, args, context risk, limits, confirmation |
| Post-tool gate | **Full** — `post_tool_gate.py` (436 lines), 4 scans: PII, secrets, injection, size |
| Arg validation | **Full** — `validation/validator.py` + Pydantic schemas + injection patterns |
| Tests | **Full** — comprehensive test suite for all gates |
| Kit generator | **None** — working code exists but no packaging/templating |
| Framework support | LangGraph only — no CrewAI/AutoGen/raw Python wrappers |

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] **Generation endpoint:** `POST /agents/:id/integration-kit` → returns generated code files
- [ ] **Pre-tool gate snippet:** Python function parameterized with agent's RBAC + limits config
- [ ] **Post-tool gate snippet:** Python function parameterized with agent's policy pack settings (PII on/off, secrets on/off, etc.)
- [ ] **Arg validation schemas:** Pydantic models generated from registered tool schemas
- [ ] **Framework integration — LangGraph:** Graph node wrappers (`add_protection(graph)`)
- [ ] **Framework integration — raw Python:** `protected_tool_call()` wrapper function
- [ ] **Framework integration — proxy-only:** One-line base_url change
- [ ] **Env vars:** `.env.protector` with all required variables
- [ ] **Test file:** `test_security.py` with 4 smoke tests (RBAC block, injection block, PII redact, confirmation trigger)
- [ ] **Download all:** .zip with all files, README with integration instructions
- [ ] **Max 7 files in kit:** The integration kit contains exactly these files — no more:
  1. `rbac.yaml` — role-tool permission matrix
  2. `limits.yaml` — per-role rate limits, token budgets, cost caps
  3. `policy.yaml` — scanner toggles, thresholds, redaction mode
  4. `protected_agent.py` (or `langgraph_protection.py`) — wrapper code for the chosen framework
  5. `.env.protector` — all required env vars
  6. `test_security.py` — smoke tests (RBAC, injection, PII, limits)
  7. `README.md` — integration instructions, what each file does, how to run tests
- [ ] **UI — Wizard step 5:** Integration kit preview with per-file copy/download
- [ ] **UI — Integration tab:** Same content, accessible after wizard
- [ ] **Test:** Generate kit → extract → run `pytest test_security.py` → 4 tests pass

---

### Req 5: At least one real attack validation flow

User must see after integration: unauthorized → BLOCK, PII → REDACT, injection → BLOCK, over-budget → BLOCK/WARN.

#### Current state

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Unauthorized → BLOCK | **Working** — `_check_rbac()` in pre_tool_gate |
| PII → REDACT | **Working** — `scan_pii()` in post_tool_gate |
| Injection → BLOCK | **Working** — `_check_args()` + `scan_injection()` |
| Over-budget → BLOCK | **Working** — `_check_limits()` in pre_tool_gate (always BLOCK, no WARN) |
| Attack scenarios | **Working** — `scenarios.py` serves catalogue, `attack-scenarios-panel.vue` shows them |
| Automated validation runner | **None** — all scenarios are manual (user clicks and sends) |

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] **Validation runner:** `POST /agents/:id/validate` runs automated attack suite against agent's config
- [ ] **Test pack:** At least "basic" pack with 12 tests covering all 4 categories:
  - 3× RBAC: unauthorized tool call → BLOCKED
  - 3× injection: prompt injection in args → BLOCKED
  - 3× PII/secrets: sensitive data in output → REDACTED
  - 3× limits: over-budget/rate-limit → BLOCKED or WARNED
- [ ] **Results API:** Returns per-test: name, category, expected, actual, passed/failed, recommendation
- [ ] **Score:** Percentage pass rate (e.g., 11/12 = 92%)
- [ ] **Fix recommendations:** Failed tests include actionable fix suggestions
- [ ] **UI — Wizard step 6:** Run validation after integration, see results inline
- [ ] **UI — Validation tab:** Full validation history, re-run button, scorecard
- [ ] **Over-budget WARN:** Limits check returns WARN (not just BLOCK) when budget is close to exhaustion
- [ ] **Source of truth:** Validation tests run against the **generated config + AI Protector runtime** (gates, RBAC service, limits service), NOT against the user's live agent. This means: tests prove that the policy model works correctly. They do NOT prove that the user integrated it correctly. The UI must clearly state: "These tests validate your AI Protector configuration. To verify end-to-end integration, use the smoke tests in your integration kit." This distinction prevents users from thinking "I tested my agent" when they only tested the policy model.
- [ ] **Test properties:** Basic pack tests must be: (a) **deterministic** — same config → same results, no LLM randomness in basic pack, (b) **versioned** — each test has a version number, results reference test version, (c) **tied to policy pack version** — when the policy pack changes, the test pack version bumps. This enables cross-version comparison ("did v1.2 of finance pack break anything?").
- [ ] **Test:** Register agent with demo config → run validation → all 12 basic tests pass

---

### Req 6: Observe / Warn / Enforce rollout modes

Nobody wants hard blocks on day one. Progressive rollout is critical for adoption.

#### Current state

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Working code | **None** — zero implementation |
| Config | **None** — no `AI_PROTECTOR_MODE` env var, no `rollout_mode` field |
| Gate behavior | Always enforces — pre-tool gate always BLOCKs, no observe/warn bypass |
| Documentation | `07-rollout-modes.md` — full spec (385 lines) |

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] **Mode enum:** `observe | warn | enforce` (strict is v2)
- [ ] **Agent field:** `rollout_mode` on Agent model, default `observe`
- [ ] **API:** `PATCH /agents/:id` to change rollout mode
- [ ] **API:** `POST /agents/:id/promote` with from/to/reason
- [ ] **Pre-tool gate behavior:**
  - `observe` → log decision, allow through (adds `would_block: true` to trace)
  - `warn` → log decision, send alert, allow through
  - `enforce` → block/redact as implemented today
- [ ] **Post-tool gate behavior:** Same 3 modes for redaction decisions
- [ ] **Trace tagging:** Every trace includes `rollout_mode` field showing which mode was active
- [ ] **Stats API:** `GET /agents/:id/stats` returns observe-mode stats (would-be-blocked count, false positive rate)
- [ ] **Promotion readiness:** `GET /agents/:id/promotion-readiness` checks criteria (min days, FP rate, latency)
- [ ] **False positive rate — definition:** FP rate is computed from three sources: (a) **manual review labels** — operator marks a blocked/redacted event as "false positive" in UI, (b) **dismissed incidents** — incidents that the operator dismisses without action are counted as likely FPs, (c) **observed-but-allowed** — in observe mode, events that `would_block: true` but were allowed through and caused no downstream incident. Without a concrete definition, promotion readiness criteria ("FP rate < 5%") is unmeasurable.
- [ ] **UI — Rollout tab:** Mode selector (observe/warn/enforce), promotion readiness checklist, stats, promote/rollback buttons
- [ ] **UI — Wizard step 7:** Set initial rollout mode (defaults to observe)
- [ ] **Test:** Set agent to observe → trigger block → tool call proceeds → trace shows `would_block: true`; switch to enforce → same trigger → tool call blocked

---

### Req 7: Traces with decision + reason

User must see: what tool, what role, what blocked it, was output redacted, which policy fired.

#### Current state

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| TraceAccumulator | **Full** — `trace/accumulator.py` (257 lines), records all gate decisions |
| TraceStore | **Full** — `trace/store.py` (164 lines), in-memory LRU with filtering |
| Langfuse export | **Full** — `trace/langfuse.py` (183 lines), structured spans |
| API | **Full** — `GET /agent/traces`, `GET /agent/traces/{id}`, `GET /agent/traces/{id}/export` |
| Frontend — traces page | **Full** — `pages/agent-traces.vue` with table, filters, detail expansion |
| Frontend — trace panel | **Full** — `components/agent/trace-panel.vue` with real-time sidebar |
| Persistence | **In-memory only** — traces lost on restart |

#### Definition of Done

- [ ] **Already working (verify):**
  - Trace shows tool name, role, decision (ALLOW/BLOCK/REDACT), reason, risk score
  - Trace shows which pre-tool check triggered (RBAC/injection/args/limits/confirmation)
  - Trace shows post-tool actions (PII redacted, secrets found, injection in output, size truncated)
  - Trace panel shows in real-time during agent chat
  - Trace list page with filters (role, date, has_blocks)
  - Langfuse export with structured spans
- [ ] **Per-agent filtering:** Traces page filters by agent_id (currently all traces from one demo agent)
- [ ] **Rollout mode in trace:** Each trace includes `rollout_mode` field (depends on Req 6)
- [ ] **PostgreSQL persistence:** Traces stored in DB — at minimum agent_id, session_id, role, decision summary, risk_score, timestamp, and a JSONB column for the full trace payload. If Agents is a product pillar, in-memory traces create a "demo-like" perception that undermines trust. Basic DB persistence is required for v1, not optional.
- [ ] **Global Traces page:** Accessible from sidebar, shows traces across all agents
- [ ] **Agent Detail → Traces tab:** Shows traces for that specific agent only
- [ ] **Test:** Send agent request → trace appears in UI within 1s → all fields populated → export JSON matches

---

## What is explicitly NOT in v1

| Feature | Why not |
|---------|---------|
| Super rozbudowany policy builder | Policies section exists, enough for v1 |
| Full policy-as-code (Git sync) | Nice-to-have, not blocking product truth |
| Multi-team governance | Single-team is fine for v1 |
| Advanced analytics | Basic stats per agent are enough |
| HA / scaling | Single-instance Docker is fine for v1 |
| 10+ framework integrations | LangGraph + raw Python + proxy-only = enough |
| Red Team engine | Separate pillar, not needed for agent protection |
| Strict rollout mode | observe/warn/enforce is enough for v1 |
| Auto-import OpenAI function schemas | Manual tool registration is fine |
| ML-based attack detection | Regex/rule-based is enough for v1 |

---

## Summary matrix

| # | Requirement | Code | UI | End-to-end | Effort |
|---|------------|------|----|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Agent registration | None | None | **No** | Medium |
| 2 | Tools + roles | Full (YAML) | None | **Partial** | Medium |
| 3 | Generated config | Partial | Policy only | **Partial** | Medium |
| 4 | Integration kit | Full (ref impl) | None | **Partial** | Large |
| 5 | Attack validation | Full | Manual only | **Partial** | Medium |
| 6 | Rollout modes | None | None | **No** | Large |
| 7 | Traces | Full | Full | **Yes** | Small (filtering) |

### What works today

- All gate logic (pre-tool, post-tool, RBAC, limits, validation, PII, secrets, injection)
- Full trace pipeline with real-time UI
- Attack scenarios panel (manual)
- Policy CRUD
- Agent demo as reference implementation

### What must be built

- Agent CRUD API + DB model
- Tool/role CRUD API + DB model
- Config generation from agent profile
- Integration kit packaging/download
- Automated validation runner
- Rollout mode logic in gates
- "Agents" section in sidebar + wizard + detail pages

---

## Biggest product risk

The risk is not in the backend. The risk is building CRUD + tables + wizard + generators and still not delivering the real moment: "I plugged this in and my agent is actually protected."

v1 must obsessively guard three things:

### A. Integration kit works for real

Not just a preview in the UI — real files that the user downloads, drops into their project, and they work. If the generated `test_security.py` doesn't pass when the user runs `pytest`, the product has failed.

### B. Validation gives real feedback

Not just "pass 12/12" — the user must see what happened and why. A failed test must explain: what attack was tried, what was expected, what actually happened, and what to change. A passing test must show the gate decision trail.

### C. Rollout doesn't block adoption

Observe mode must work smoothly. If a user has to choose between "hard block everything" and "no protection", most will choose no protection. The observe → warn → enforce gradient is what makes enterprises say yes.

---

## Existing Agent Demo

The current Agent Demo (`/agent`) becomes:

**Option A (recommended):** Agents → Demo Agent — listed as a pre-configured reference agent in the Agents list, non-deletable, marked as "Reference Implementation"

**Option B:** Separate "Showcase" section — risk of confusing demo with real onboarding

The demo agent code in `apps/agent-demo/` remains the reference implementation that all generated integration kits are based on.

---

## Release gate tiers

Not everything ships at once. Split deliverables into what blocks the release vs what ships right after.

### Core release gate (must ship for v1 launch)

- Agent CRUD API + DB model (Req 1)
- Tools + roles CRUD API + DB model (Req 2)
- Publish config flow (Req 2)
- Config generation from agent profile (Req 3)
- Integration kit — template-based, max 7 files (Req 4)
- Validation runner — basic pack, 12 tests (Req 5)
- Per-agent traces with DB persistence (Req 7)
- Frontend: Agents list, New Agent wizard (7 steps), Agent detail with tabs
- Sidebar restructure (Agents section)

### Ship right after (v1.1 — days, not weeks)

- Observe / warn / enforce modes (Req 6)
- Promotion readiness + FP rate computation (Req 6)
- Richer stats per agent (blocked/redacted/allowed breakdown)
- Rollback sophistication (rollback to previous mode with reason audit)
- Advanced validation packs beyond "basic"

> **Rationale:** The core gate delivers the magic moment ("I secured my agent"). Rollout modes are critical for production adoption but don't block the initial "is this product useful?" answer. Shipping rollout as v1.1 within days ensures it's not deprioritized.

---

## Implementation order

Priority: reach the magic moment ("user can secure an agent") as fast as possible. Rollout modes are important but not the first magic moment — config → kit → validation is.

1. **Agent CRUD + DB** (Req 1) — everything else hangs on this
2. **Tools + Roles CRUD** (Req 2) — needed for config generation
3. **Config generation** (Req 3) — depends on 1+2, first tangible output
4. **Integration kit** (Req 4) — depends on 3, **highest risk item** — this is where user either gets value or bounces
5. **Validation runner** (Req 5) — depends on 4, completes the magic moment ("paste code → run test → see BLOCKED")
6. **Rollout modes** (Req 6) — important for adoption, but user already has value from steps 3-5
7. **Trace per-agent filtering + DB persistence** (Req 7) — depends on 1+6
8. **Frontend: Agents section + wizard** — parallel with backend, depends on APIs

> **Rationale for rollout after validation:** If time is tight, it's better to ship config + kit + validation first (user can secure an agent) and add rollout modes immediately after (user can deploy safely). Rollout without a working kit is useless; a working kit without rollout is still valuable (user just deploys in enforce mode).

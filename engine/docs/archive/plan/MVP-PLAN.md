# MVP Implementation Plan

> Spec-driven development: each step has its own folder with detailed docs and a Definition of Done.
> Check off items as they are completed. Work through steps sequentially — each builds on the previous.

## Phase 6: Enterprise Readiness (week 7–8)

- [ ] **[Step 17 — Observe / Simulate Mode](17-observe-simulate/SPEC.md)**
  Per-policy observe mode: pipeline runs fully but BLOCK → ALLOW; logs `original_decision` for audit.
  Shows enterprise deployment maturity — teams validate policies on live traffic before enforcing.
  - [ ] 17a — Policy model `mode` column + migration
  - [ ] 17b — Pipeline mode-gate node (after decision)
  - [ ] 17c — Request model: `original_decision` + `mode` columns, API filters
  - [ ] 17d — Frontend: policy toggle, "would block" chips, observe analytics

- [ ] **[Step 18 — Explainability](18-explainability/SPEC.md)**
  Structured explanation for every decision: which rules matched, which scanners triggered,
  per-signal risk breakdown, threshold comparison. Critical for compliance & developer trust.
  - [ ] 18a — ExplainNode + decomposed `calculate_risk_breakdown()`
  - [ ] 18b — `explanation` JSONB column, persistence, API
  - [ ] 18c — Frontend: risk breakdown bar, matched rules, threshold gauge

- [ ] **[Step 19 — Replay Requests](19-replay-requests/SPEC.md)**
  Click any log entry → replay through pipeline with different policy/model → side-by-side
  comparison of decisions. Zero LLM cost (pre-LLM pipeline only). Powerful for policy tuning.
  - [ ] 19a — `POST /v1/requests/{id}/replay` endpoint + comparison schema
  - [ ] 19b — `messages_json` persistence in Request model (opt-in)
  - [ ] 19c — Comparison builder with delta computation
  - [ ] 19d — Frontend: replay dialog, side-by-side diff view

## Phase 7: Demo & Polish

- [x] **[Step 20 — Attack Scenarios Panel](20-attack-scenarios-panel/SPEC.md)**
  Floating side panel with **260 ready-made attack prompts** (157 Playground + 103 Agent) covering
  injection, jailbreak, PII, exfil, toxicity, tool abuse, role bypass, system prompt leaking,
  cognitive hacking, misinformation, few-shot manipulation, excessive agency, resource exhaustion,
  multi-turn escalation, chain-of-thought attacks. One click → auto-submit. Tag filter + OWASP labels.
  Both Playground & Agent Demo. Skull FAB toggle, panels collapsed by default.
  - [x] 20a — Types + scenario data (14 Playground groups / 157 prompts, 12 Agent groups / 103 prompts)
  - [x] 20b — `AttackScenariosPanel.vue` component (search, tag filter, grouped buttons, decision chips)
  - [x] 20c — Playground integration (toggle, auto-send, chat input expose)
  - [x] 20d — Agent Demo integration (toggle, auto-send, chat input expose)

## Phase 8: OSS Maturity

- [x] **[Step 21 — OSS Maturity & Project Hygiene](21-oss-maturity/SPEC.md)**
  Transform the repo into a credible open-source project: LICENSE, community files,
  CI/CD, security scanning, Dependabot, badges, release tagging.
  - [x] 21a — MIT License
  - [x] 21b — Community files (CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, issue/PR templates)
  - [x] 21c — GitHub Actions CI (ci.yml, codeql.yml, dependency-review.yml)
  - [x] 21d — Dependabot configuration
  - [x] 21e — Fix failing unit tests (13 tests — missing mocks + wrong DenylistHit types)
  - [x] 21f — README badges (CI, CodeQL, License, Python, Nuxt)
  - [ ] 21g — First release tag v0.1.0
  - [ ] 21h — Branch protection rules (GitHub UI)
  - [ ] 21i — Repository settings polish (topics, social preview, discussions)

## Phase 9: Agent Security Hardening

- [x] **[Step 22 — NeMo Guardrails Integration](22-nemo-guardrails/SPEC.md)**
  Integrate NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails as a new parallel scanner node. Colang 1.0 rails
  for 11 attack categories (role bypass, tool abuse, exfiltration, social engineering,
  CoT manipulation, RAG poisoning, confused deputy, cross-tool, excessive agency,
  hallucination exploitation, supply chain). Embedding-only mode with FastEmbed
  (zero LLM calls, ~7.5ms latency). Expanded agent intent classifier with 70+ patterns.
  - [x] 22a — NeMo Guardrails scanner node (lazy init, thread pool, error isolation)
  - [x] 22b — Colang Rails Library (11 flows, 100+ example messages, semantic matching)
  - [x] 22c — Agent Intent Expansion (4 new intents, decision weights, risk flags)
  - [x] 22d — Policy & Pipeline Integration (seed update, scanner wiring, Docker, pentest verification)

## Phase 10: Multi-Provider & Compare Demo

- [ ] **[Step 23 — External LLM Providers](23-external-providers/SPEC.md)**
  Transform AI Protector from Ollama-only into a universal LLM firewall supporting
  OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral. API keys stored in browser SessionStorage
  (zero server persistence). LiteLLM auto-routing by model name. `x-api-key` header.
  - [ ] 23a — Backend provider routing (`detect_provider()`, `format_litellm_model()`, `GET /v1/models`)
  - [ ] 23b — Frontend: Settings page (API key dialog, SessionStorage/localStorage, model selector)

- [ ] **[Step 24 — Compare Playground](24-compare-playground/SPEC.md)**
  Side-by-side demo: protected (proxy pipeline) vs unprotected (direct to LLM).
  Single prompt fires both endpoints simultaneously. Shows value of AI Protector instantly.
  - [ ] 24a — Direct bypass endpoint (`POST /v1/chat/direct`, disabled by default in prod)
  - [ ] 24b — Compare UI (dual-panel streaming, decision card, timing, attack scenarios)
